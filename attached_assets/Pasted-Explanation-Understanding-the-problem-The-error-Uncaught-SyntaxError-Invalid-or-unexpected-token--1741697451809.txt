Explanation

Understanding the problem
The error "Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token (at countries.js:1114:11)" indicates that the JavaScript engine encountered a syntax error in your countries.js file at line 1114, column 11. This means there's a character or a sequence of characters at that location that the JavaScript parser doesn't recognize as valid JavaScript syntax. Common causes include:

Typographical errors: A misspelled keyword, an extra or missing character, etc.
Incorrect character encoding: If the file is not saved with UTF-8 encoding.
Copy-paste errors: When code is copied from another source and special characters or non-standard spaces are introduced.
Unterminated strings or comments: A string or comment that is not properly closed.
Using reserved keywords incorrectly: JavaScript keywords used in places they are not allowed.
How to verify
Open countries.js: Open the countries.js file in your code editor.
Go to line 1114: Navigate directly to line 1114 in the editor.
Examine column 11: Carefully inspect the character at column 11 and its surrounding context on that line.
Check surrounding code: Look at the lines immediately before and after line 1114 to identify if the issue stems from a syntax problem in neighboring code.
Look for special characters: Search for characters that might look like normal characters but are not, such as invisible spaces.
Check the file encoding: Confirm that the file is saved as UTF-8.
Suggested fix
Based on the error message, a likely cause is a hidden or invalid character that can't be recognized by the JavaScript interpreter. Here's how to address this:

Identify the problematic character: The error message points to line 1114, character 11. In the context of the error, let's assume this location contains a character that is not valid in a JavaScript file.
Delete and Re-enter In the text editor, select the character and delete it. Then type the expected character again in its place.
Save the file Save the file once you've made this change.
